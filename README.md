## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I learned how to read a file using the BufferedReader class, create a JLabel object and use it to add
an image to the welcome screen.



One challenge I faced was figuring how to get the program to add 'y' as a vowel at the appropriate time. I orginally 
wanted to have the program read a file containing all of the english words that have y as a vowel, but I couldn't find such a 
list online. I briefly tried to create several conditional statements that could detect when 'y' mmight be a vowel instead. In the end, I decided
the best use of my time can be spent creating my own list of words and have the program reference that file. This was definitely faster, and less complicated.
